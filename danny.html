        <p> My name is Danny Lam, I was born in California, and I like to spend most of my time on my laptop talking or playing games with my friends. A few goals of mine is to do well in school so I can get into a college that I would be content with. I am mainly looking East for college, so doing my best will be important towards that. Another one of my goals is to be more involved in music, as it is something that I love to do. I 'm not too specific in which category of music, but mostly I would prefer to play the violin or piano, along with singing. I have not been that involved with any music class in quite some years now, so I definitely want to get back into it. Something that I am deeply passionate towards is Interact, which is an international club, mainly found in high schools. Interact is all about community service, and comitting to that service more than your are committed to yourself. Through Interact, I have gotten to learn more about the world around me, and meet many new people who I've begun to love, or just enjoy being around. I will definitely be going into the club called Rotary, which is what it is called in College.My Favorite Quote is "Service above Self." Though this quote is fairly short, it is a commonly used quote by Interactors, and something that I deeply connect with.</p>
